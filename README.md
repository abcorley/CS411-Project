Within the docs folder contains more information including: 5 user stories, the tech stack, and a link to a video demoing the app.

## App's Purpose 
A mobile app that allows users to create their own workout program and schedule. The user would create their own workout program by selecting the days of the week they would workout, how many weeks the program would run, what areas they want to target, and what exercises they want to do. We would be using the WGER Workout Manager API to retrieve information on the various exercises the user can pick from that correspond to the various target areas, such as cardio, abs, arms, legs, etc., and display information such as how to perform the workout. In addition, we would add other features to help the user maintain their nutrition such as a calorie tracker and a recipe search that will use the Spoonacular API to retrieve a list of recipes matching the users search and displaying information on it.

## Tech Stack
